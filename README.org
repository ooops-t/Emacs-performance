#+TITLE: Emacs Performance

-----
Emacs is a Lisp interpreter that was developed long before, making it a remarkably old piece of software—older than most of our parents. Over the years, I’ve gained a great deal of knowledge about Emacs, largely thanks to its dedicated community. From informative YouTube videos to the discussions on r/Emacs, the wealth of resources available has been invaluable in my learning journey.

** Building from source
Highly recommend building Emacs from the source code, it allows modifying the source code to building the custom version for performance and its not hard by any means, multiple guides available on this topics.

These flags gave me the best performance.
#+begin_src sh
./autogen.sh \
       && ./configure CFLAGS="-march=native -Ofast -fno-finite-math-only -pipe \
-fgraphite-identity -floop-nest-optimize -fdevirtualize-at-ltrans -fipa-pta \
-fno-semantic-interposition" \

** Emacs daemon (must)
Emacs has the slow startup issue which prevents a lot of users from using it but out of the box it's loading is blazing fast. However most users will face it when they start developing their 'init.el'.

Emacs daemon is a server whose purpose is load the 'init.el' at the startup. So, there is no need to load it again and again. Greatly improves the startup time.

Enabling daemon.
#+begin_src shell
systemctl --user enable emacs.service
systemctl --user start emacs.service

# when need to restart emacs daemon
systemctl --user restart emacs.service
#+end_src

Connect using *emacsclient*
#+begin_src shell
emacsclient -a '' -c -n"
#+end_src

** Early-init.el
A dedicated file to reduce the loading time, mainly I use for garbage collection, UI and  setting fonts.

*** Increase 'gc-cons-threshold' to 100MB for lsp heavy buffers.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000) ;;

;; Improve performance with language servers.
(setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)) ;; 1 MB
#+end_src

*** Tree-sitter performance enhancement
#+begin_src elisp
(setenv "LSP_USE_PLISTS" "true")
(setq lsp-use-plists t)
#+end_src

*** Disable *startup/file-name-handler-alist* than enable it later for speed.
#+begin_src elisp
;; Disable "file-name-handler-alist" than enable it later for speed.
(defvar startup/file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist)
(setq file-name-handler-alist nil)
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
          (lambda ()
            (setq file-name-handler-alist startup/file-name-handler-alist)
            (makunbound 'startup/file-name-handler-alist)))
#+end_src

*** Speed up package loading and loads package only when needed
#+begin_src elisp
(setq package-quickstart t)

(setq use-package-always-defer t)
#+end_src

*** Suppress the startup, *scratch* buffer will be home buffer.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq
inhibit-splash-screen t
inhibit-startup-screen t
inhibit-startup-message t
inhibit-startup-buffer-menu t)
#+end_src

*** Disable backup files and modeline while loading.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq
mode-line-format nil
make-backup-files nil
backup-directory-alist '((".*" . "~/.local/share/Trash/files")))
#+end_src

*** Scratch with fundamental-mode
Important to setup the scratch buffer to open with 'fundamental-mode' so it doesn't increase load time.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq initial-major-mode 'fundamental-mode)
#+end_src

*** Fonts
Make sure to avoid 'set-face-attributes'
#+begin_src elisp
(custom-set-faces
 ;; Default font for all text
 '(default ((t (:family "Roboto Mono" :height 110))))
 '(fixed-pitch ((t (:family "Roboto Mono" :height 100))))

 ;; Current line number
 '(line-number-current-line ((t (:foreground "yellow" :inherit line-number))))
 '(mode-line ((t (:family "Roboto Mono" :weight Bold))))

 ;; Comments italic
 '(font-lock-function-name-face ((t (:family "Roboto Mono":slant italic))))
 '(font-lock-variable-name-face ((t (:family "Roboto Mono":weight bold)))))
#+end_src

** Init.el
Moving towards the main file 'init.el', first thing I want in my personal configuration is setting 'native-comp' speed and flags. They are important for getting the performance.

*** Maximum native eln speed
Changing native-comp-speed for performance
#+begin_src elisp
(setq native-comp-speed 3)

(native-compile-async "/usr/lib/emacs/30.2/native-lisp" 'recursively)
(setq native-comp-compiler-options '("-march=znver3" "-Ofast" "-g0" "-fno-finite-math-only" "-fgraphite-identity" "-floop-nest-optimize" "-fdevirtualize-at-ltrans" "-fipa-pta" "-fno-semantic-interposition" "-flto=auto" "-fuse-linker-plugin"))

(setq native-comp-driver-options '("-march=znver3" "-Ofast" "-g0" "-fno-finite-math-only" "-fgraphite-identity" "-floop-nest-optimize" "-fdevirtualize-at-ltrans" "-fipa-pta" "-fno-semantic-interposition" "-flto=auto" "-fuse-linker-plugin"))
#+end_src

Make sure you set the 'native-lisp' location correctly otherwise there will be an error in the starting. Use 'C-h v native-comp-eln-load-path' to check the location. The flags used above are for the AMD Zen 3 processors, use accordingly.

*** Use straight.el
'*Use-package*' will install the packages but it doesn't compile them which will we needed here.

*** use-package-compute-statistics
Useful to know how much time packages are taking. They need to be on the top of init.el in order to use 'use-package-report' function.
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'use-package)
(setq use-package-compute-statistics t)
#+end_src


*** use-package
I highly recommend reading [[https://batsov.com/articles/2025/04/17/using-use-package-the-right-way/][Using use-package the right way]], summary is avoid *:init*, *:config*, *:preface* because they initialize the package at the startup. Also, when *:hook* is used you don't need *:defer*.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
ℹ️ Thank to @hkjels for pointing out, the Emacs daemon significantly reduces startup time, so deferring package loading isn't always necessary. In many cases, eagerly loading packages can improve the overall experience by avoiding delays during actual usage
#+END_QUOTE

Google 'How to reduce Emacs loading time', these guides will suggest using :defer which I used everywhere without thinking. As a result there was no improvement instead use :hook, :custom, :bind and :mode.

1) :hook - defer package loading until specific modes activates.
2) :custom - configures package settings without triggering
3) :bind - load when key is used.
4) :mode - load modes when specific files are opened such as org.
4) :commands - autoloadable without immediate loading.

some examples of :hook, :custom, :bind, :mode and :commands

:hook
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package
:ensure t
:straight t
:hook nerd-icons)
#+end_src

:custom
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package kind-icon
  :ensure t
  :straight t
  :hook (corfu-mode . (lambda ()
                        (add-to-list 'corfu-margin-formatters #'kind-icon-margin-formatter)
                        (add-hook 'modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook #'kind-icon-reset-cache)
                        (add-hook 'ef-themes-post-load-hook #'kind-icon-reset-cache)))
  :custom
  (kind-icon-use-icons t)
  (kind-icon-default-face 'corfu-default)
  (kind-icon-blend-background nil)
  (kind-icon-blend-frac 0.08))
#+end_src

:bind
#+begin_src elisp
;; bind
(use-package ace-jump-mode
  :ensure t
  :straight t
  :hook (emacs-startup . ace-jump-mode)
  :bind
  ("C-c j" . 'ace-jump-mode))
(add-hook 'ace-jump-mode-before-jump-hook (lambda ()
                                            (message "I am jumping")))
#+end_src

:mode
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org
  :ensure t
  :straight t
  :mode ("\\.org\\'" . org-mode))
#+end_src

:commands
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package vterm
  :ensure t
  :straight t
  :commands (vterm))
#+end_src

*** Avoid require & load
'require' loads a package or file once per Emacs session, and does not reload it on subsequent calls and 'load' loads and evaluates a file every time is is called. Instead use '*autoload*', it is designed for lazy loading and helps reduce startup time.
#+begin_src elisp
;; require 
(require 'somepackage)

;; load
(load "path/to/some-file.el")
#+end_src

*** Lsp
Disable lsp logging.
#+begin_src elisp
(lsp-log-io nil)
#+end_src

*** Disable line number with large files
#+begin_src elisp
(defun disable-line-numbers-if-large-file ()
  "Disable line numbers if the buffer has more than 1000 lines."
  (when (> (count-lines (point-min) (point-max)) 1000)
    (display-line-numbers-mode 0)))

(add-hook 'find-file-hook #'disable-line-numbers-if-large-file)
#+end_src

*** Simpc
c mode to open the large C files.
#+begin_src elisp
(defun enable-simpc-mode-if-large-c-file ()
  "Enable simpc-mode if the buffer is a C file and has more than 1000 lines."
  (when (and (derived-mode-p 'c-mode) ; Check if it's a C mode buffer
             (> (count-lines (point-min) (point-max)) 1000))
    (simpc-mode 1)))

(add-hook 'find-file-hook #'enable-simpc-mode-if-large-c-file)
#+end_src
